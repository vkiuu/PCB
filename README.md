# Promo Code Bot [PCB]

PCB is a bot used for copying any kind of promotion codes from a Twitter account and pasting it on a website.

## Configuration

Configuration step by step:
1. Run 'setup.py' & fill out the necessary boxes.
2. If using PCB v2 install Tesseract OCR:
   On Windows: Download the installer from the official Tesseract repository on GitHub (https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and run it.
   On macOS: Install Tesseract using Homebrew by running the command brew install tesseract.
   On Linux: Use the package manager specific to your distribution. On Ubuntu, you can install Tesseract by running sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr. 
3. The program should be ready to run.

## Usage

After configuration,PCB.py should display the following message:"code is now running..."; 
if that happens you should select the input box you want the code to be entered in and wait
until the program pastes the promotion code in the input box.
