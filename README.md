- 29 [put in the ID of the account]
- 59 & 66 [put in the length of desired code plus 4(for 20 put in 24)]

## Usage

After configuration, run PCB.py program. It should display the following message: 
"code is now running..."; if that happens you should immediately select the input 
box you want the code to be entered in and wait until the program pastes in the promotion code.
